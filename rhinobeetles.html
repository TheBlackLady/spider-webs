                        <h3>RHINOBEETLES</h3>
                        <p>
                            Rhino-beetles are fascinating insects known for their impressive horns and robust bodies. They belong to the family Scarabaeidae and are found in various parts of the world, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. These beetles are named for their horn-like structures, which can vary in size and shape depending on the species. Rhino-beetles are primarily herbivorous, feeding on decaying plant matter, fruits, and tree sap.</p>
                        <p> Rhino-beetles are not only known for their unique appearance but also for their strength. Some species can lift objects many times their own weight, making them one of the strongest animals relative to their size. They play a crucial role in the ecosystem by helping to decompose organic matter and aerate the soil.</p>
