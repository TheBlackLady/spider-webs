                        <h3>TIGERS</h3>
                        <p>
                            Tigers are the largest cat species in the world, known for their distinctive orange coat with black stripes. They are solitary hunters and primarily inhabit forests, grasslands, and wetlands across Asia. Tigers are apex predators, preying on large ungulates such as deer and wild boar. They are also known for their powerful build and strength, making them one of the most formidable predators in the animal kingdom.</p>
                        <p> Tigers are classified as endangered due to habitat loss and poaching for their fur and body parts. Conservation efforts are underway to protect their habitats and reduce human-wildlife conflict.</p>
                        <P> 
                            Tigers are known for their incredible strength and agility, capable of running at speeds up to 40 miles per hour. They are also excellent swimmers, often seen cooling off in water bodies during hot weather. Their keen sense of hearing and sight makes them effective hunters, allowing them to stalk prey silently through dense vegetation.</p>
                        Tigers are solitary animals, with each individual maintaining a large territory that they mark and defend from others. They typically come together only during mating season or when a mother is raising her cubs.
