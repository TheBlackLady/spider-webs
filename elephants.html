                        <h3>ELEPHANTS</h3>
                        <p>The elephant is the largest living land animal. This giant, plant-eating mammal lives in family groups with complex social orders and is capable of remarkable feats of memory – they do say elephants never forget!</p>
                <P>The elephant is the largest living land animal. This giant, plant-eating mammal lives in family groups with complex social orders and is capable of remarkable feats of memory – they do say elephants never forget! Elephants are comparable in size to some of the biggest animals to have ever walked the Earth. Elephants can recognise people from different ethnic groups and can distinguish between friends from foes.Elephants can’t sweat. It takes around a year for a baby elephant to learn how to fully control its trunk
Their loudest articulations are as powerful as a thunderclap.Elephants have the largest brains of any land animal.Elephants are easily identifiable by their long trunks, large grey bodies, big ears and in some cases, ivory tusks. Elephants are the largest living land animal and their size is comparable to that of some of the biggest animals to have ever walked the Earth. The biggest of the three living species of elephant is the African savanna elephant (Loxodonta africana),African forest elephant(L. cyclotis) and Asian elephant (Elephant Maximus).</P>

<p>Did you know Asian elephants’ ears look a little similar in shape to the outline of India, while African elephants’ ears are similar in shape to Africa – it’s an easy way to tell them apart!</p>

                      <p> WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</p>
            <P> You will find the elephants at pen E22, right next to the Amphitheatre.</P>
